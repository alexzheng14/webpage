Due to my background in healthcare, I had attempted to make a healthcare patient portal via LAMP (Linux, APache, MySQL, PHP) stack which runs on CENTOS. This patient portal is built to provide a secure login access and has the potential to expand on further services. 

The web page omplements several cybersecurity skills that I have learned through Flatiron such as implementing a role-based-access control (RBAC) to enforce the least privilege principle and a strong password policy.
